# Surfs up
## Overview of Project
Our client wants information about temperature trends before opening their surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Lets take a closer look at the analysis and our findings:-

### Comparison between June and December

* December has a lower maximum temperature of 83°F compared to June`s temperature of 85°F
* December has a lower minimum temperrature of 56°F compared to June`s temperature of 64°F
* December has a lower average temperrature of 71°F compared to June`s temperature of 75°F


## Summary
The average temperature between the months of June and December are very similar (75°F for June and 71°F for December). As such, December weather conditions are perfect for both surfing and ice cream.

According to the temperature data we can conclude that a surf and ice cream shop should be a good business venture all year round.

Two additional queries that would be beneficial to our analysis are:
* A query on weather trends like rainfall or storms. As bad storms or heavy rainfall will hinder the business.
* Secondly, a query on other metrics such as Wind speeds, tourist numbers in Hawaii can be made. It would be unwise to base the entire business decision on temperature alone.
